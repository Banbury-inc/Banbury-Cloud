#Intro

This is the frontend to the Banbury Cloud Desktop Applicaiton. The primary reason why I chose to implement this through
electron is because I needed the ability to perform operations on the device. This is difficult to do in a web app.  


## Getting Started

1. Using NPM 7+, run the following command to install dependencies

```sh
npm install --force
```

2. Run the following command to build and start the development version of your app with live reloading.

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Packaging

Run `npm run package` to build and package your electron app.

Run `npm run deploy` to build and package your electron app, along with creating the necessary installers.
